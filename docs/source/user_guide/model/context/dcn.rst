**Title:** Deep & Cross Network for Ad Click Predictions

**Authors:** Ruoxi Wang, Bin Fu, Gang Fu, Mingliang Wang

**Abstract:** Feature engineering has been the key to the success of many prediction
models. However, the process is nontrivial and oÂ‰en requires
manual feature engineering or exhaustive searching. DNNs
are able to automatically learn feature interactions; however, they
generate all the interactions implicitly, and are not necessarily efficient
in learning all types of cross features. In this paper, we propose
the Deep & Cross Network (DCN) which keeps the benefits of
a DNN model, and beyond that, it introduces a novel cross network
that is more efficient in learning certain bounded-degree feature
interactions. In particular, DCN explicitly applies feature crossing
at each layer, requires no manual feature engineering, and adds
negligible extra complexity to the DNN model. Our experimental
results have demonstrated its superiority over the state-of-art algorithms
on the CTR prediction dataset and dense classification
dataset, in terms of both model accuracy and memory usage.

Quick Start with RecBole
-------------------------

**Model Hyper-Parameters:**

- ``embedding_size (int)`` : The embedding size of features. Defaults to ``10``.
- ``mlp_hidden_size (list of int)`` : The hidden size of MLP layers. Defaults to ``[256,256,256]``.
- ``cross_layer_num (int)`` : The number of cross layers. Defaults to ``6``.
- ``reg_weight (float)`` : The L2 regularization weight. Defaults to ``2``.
- ``dropout_prob (float)`` : The dropout rate. Defaults to ``0.2``.



**A Running Example:**

Write the following code to a python file, such as `run.py`

.. code:: python

   from recbole.quick_start import run_recbole

   run_recbole(model='DCN', dataset='ml-100k')

And then:

.. code:: bash

   python run.py

Tuning Hyper Parameters
-------------------------

If you want to use ``HyperTuning`` to tune hyper parameters of this model, you can copy the following settings and name it as ``hyper.test``.

.. code:: bash

   learning_rate choice [0.01,0.005,0.001,0.0005,0.0001]
   dropout_prob choice [0.0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5]
   mlp_hidden_size choice ['[64,64,64]','[128,128,128]','[256,256,256]','[512,512,512]','[1024, 1024]']
   reg_weight choice [0.1,1,2,5,10]
   cross_layer_num choice [3,4,5,6]

Note that we just provide these hyper parameter ranges for reference only, and we can not guarantee that they are the optimal range of this model.

Then, with the source code of RecBole (you can download it from GitHub), you can run the ``run_hyper.py`` to tuning:

.. code:: bash

	python run_hyper.py --model=[model_name] --dataset=[dataset_name] --config_files=[config_files_path] --params_file=hyper.test
