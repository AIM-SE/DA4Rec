Use Weights & Biases
====================

RecBole allows visualizing configs and metrics of different experiments
with W&B.

If you are new to W&B, please set up it first.

1. Start with a W&B account. `Create one now â†’ <http://app.wandb.ai>`__

2. Go to your project folder in your terminal and install library:
   ``pip install wandb``

3. Inside your project folder, log in W&B: ``wandb login`` `your API
   key <https://wandb.ai/authorize>`__

You can start W&B in RecBole by passing ``--log_wandb=True`` as command
line argument, or use config dict. One can also turn ``log_wandb: True``
in the ``overall.yaml`` file or provide it as external config file.

**A Running Example:**

You can run BPR model on ml-100k dataset with W&B as follow:

.. code:: python

   python run_recbole.py --log_wandb=True

Then, go to your W&B project, you can see the following page, which
shows the change of metrics during the training and validation in each
epoch.

You can also check the detailed configuration information and evaluation
metrics.

W&B also allows you to compare these metrics and configs across
different experiments in the same project.

You can select different projects to experiment by modifying
``wandb_project`` parameter, which defaults to ``'recbole'``.

Documentation <https://docs.wandb.ai/>`__.
